# SQL Server hybrid cloud before the hands-on lab setup guide 

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you deploy an on-premises environment and the Azure infrastructure necessary to support the disaster recovery site in Azure. The on-premises environment will be hosted in an Azure Resource Group.

### Task 1: Deploy the on-premises environment

1. Browse to the Azure portal at <https://portal.azure.com> and verify that you are logged in with the subscription that you wish to use for this lab.

    >**Note**: You may need to launch an \"in-private\" session in your browser if you have multiple Microsoft Accounts.
    
    
    
    
2. Click the **Deploy to Azure** button below.

4. On the **Custom deployment** blade, select **Cloud Shop1-SUFFIX ** under the **Resource group**. Choose the region pair of your CloudShop2-SUFFIX resource group location. In our lab document we have chosen the **East US 2/Central US** region pair. Accept the terms and conditions and click **Purchase**.

5. Wait for the deployment to complete. This may take up to 60 minutes.


## Summary

In this exercise, you deployed and validated your "On-Premises" environment and your Azure disaster recovery site. You also verified that all three servers have successfully joined the domain. In the lab you will reconfigure your on-premises environment for high availability.

You should follow all steps provided *before* attending the Hands-on lab.
