# Introduction

In the Intelligent Analytics Lab participants will enable intelligent conversation in a machine learning-enabled, real-time chat pipeline to allow hotel guests to chat with one another, and to communicate directly with the concierge. They will also apply analytics to visualize customer sentiment in real-time. 

After completion, students will be better able to implement a lambda architecture, and enable web-based real-time messaging thru Web Sockets, Event Hubs, and Services Bus. In addition, participants will better understand how to:
* Leverage Cognitive Services (LUIS & Text Analytics API)
* Process Events with Web Jobs
* Index with Search
* Archive with Cosmos DB
* Visualize with Power BI QA
