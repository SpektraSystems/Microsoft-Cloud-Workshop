## NOTE
1. The following resources are pre-created and you need not to deploy it again while doing the lab.

    * Data Science Virtual Machine
    * Cosmos DB
    * Computer Vision API
    * Storage account

You can also find the necessary keys in the lab environment details page. You can get these keys from Azure portal also.

2. While doing **lab01.2_customvision01/1_Classification_Lab > Step 0: The API keys**, instead of creating Custom Vision API from https://customvision.ai, you can navigate to the Azure portal and create custom vision API directly through the portal in the existing resource group. Since you don't have access to create a new resource group, you should follow this step. Once it is successfully created, you can obtain a key by accessing https://customvision.ai and then clicking on the "setting" gear in the top right.
