# Verify the pre-provisioned Environment

1. Launch a browser using incognite or in-private mode, and navigate to https://portal.azure.com. Once prompted, login with the Microsoft Azure credentials you received.   

2. Once you are logged in to the portal, navigate to Resource Groups. 

3. Navigate to the resource group **ODL_az-blockchain-xxxxx-01** and view the already existing resources such as LABVM Virtual Machine, Disk, etc

4. Using a remote desktop client, open a Remote Desktop Session into the LABVM using the labvmdnsname and credentials you received

5. Now open -> **Visual Studio Code**, you will see that the Solidity Extension is already installed


## Verify Azure Access

Open a browser instance in private or incognito mode and login to [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) using the credentials provided.
