# Verify the pre-provisioned Environment

## Verify Azure Access

Open a browser instance in private or incognito mode and login to [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) using the credentials provided.

> Note: You might have an existing Azure Credential. For the pre-provisioned environment, new Microsoft Azure environment is provisioned and new AAD user is created for you. To prevent conflict with your existing accounts, it is advised to use In Private mode of IE / IE Edge or Incognito mode of Chrome browser.

Also verify two resource groups **ODL_serverless-architecture-XXXXX-01** and **ODL_serverless-architecture-XXXXX-02** already created. In resource group **ODL_serverless-architecture-XXXXX-01** you will get Azure Environment with the LABVM deployed in it

## Verify Virtual Machine

You are provided a [Visual Studio cummunity- Windows 2016](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/Microsoft.VisualStudioCommunity2017onWindowsServer2016x64?tab=Overview) with additional softwares configured with jumpvm named. FQDN of the virtual machine and administrator credentials are provided in the lab details page. You can remote into the virutal machine using the provided credentials and validate the following:

> Note: jumpvm is provisioned in the resource group, in which you have access. Once you login to Microsoft Azure Portal, you can navigate to this VM to find more details.</br></br>


## Notes to Attendees
1. Resource Group **ODL_serverless-architecture-XXXXX-01** is having jumpvm only. You will not be able to create resources in this RG.
1. You should create all the resource for the lab in **ODL_serverless-architecture-XXXXX-02** resource group.
1. When you deploy **Function App(TollBoothEvents)**, in [Exercise 1- Task 2.4](https://github.com/Microsoft/MCW-Serverless-architecture/blob/master/Hands-on%20lab/HOL%20step-by-step%20-%20Serverless%20architecture.md#task-2-provision-the-function-apps). Choose **Java Script** instead of .NET in **RunTime Stack** and for another **Function App(TollBoothFunctionApp)** in Exercise 1- Task 2.6, choose **.NET**

In [Exercise 2 Task 1.4](https://github.com/Microsoft/MCW-Serverless-architecture/blob/master/Hands-on%20lab/HOL%20step-by-step%20-%20Serverless%20architecture.md#task-1-configure-application-settings), configure **computerVisionApiUrl** similar to **https://australiaeast.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/vision/v1.0/ocr**. Here, just replace the endpoint(https://australiaeast.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/) with your computer vision endpoint url.
