To make it easier for you to work on the labs, you are provided with pre-provisioned Azure environment. You will receive sign-up link for the lab environment from your instructor. 

* Register for the lab environment by providing your information and clicking on **Submit** button.

* On the next page, click the **Launch Lab** button.
 
* Wait for the lab environment to be provisioned. Sometimes this can take upto **10 minutes**. Once environment provisioning is complete, you will receive details in email as well as in the browser.
 
 > Note: Lab environment is enabled only for specific duration or workshop end time - whichever is earlier. At the end of the allowed time, environment will be self-destructed. Also, for multi-day workshops, all virtual machines will be shutdown at 6.30 PM local time. On day 2, user should start the Virtual Machine from the lab activation page.
