# Introduction

This is a supplement guide to ‘Microsoft Cloud Workshop - [Optimized Architecture](https://github.com/Microsoft/MCW-Optimized-architecture/blob/master/Hands-on%20lab/HOL%20step-by-step%20-%20Optimized%20architecture.md)’, to be used when you are delivering a hands-on-lab session using Cloud Labs AI platform from Spektra Systems. If you have any questions, please reach out to cloudlabs-support@spektrasystems.com

In this workshop, students will learn how to optimize a lift and shift style IaaS architecture in Azure to improve cost
savings. Students will also compare IaaS and PaaS hosting options to save cost even further through the use of Azure
App Service. Additionally, students will learn to improve resiliency and high availability through multi-region
deployment.</br></br>
